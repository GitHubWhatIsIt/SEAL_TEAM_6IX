# Hirudindae species names


# Meeting Minutes

1. Delete some old files in github

2. Exploring the Hirudindae abundance over the years using "exploration.Rmd"

3. Try to clean up the "Ontario.csv" -- This takes a vast majority of time as I try to figure out way to clean up a huge dataset and not knowing how to merge.

# Assign work

Richard: generate a merge dataset of "exploration" and "vehicle"
Caroline: help with merge.
Alex: clean up on weather data.
