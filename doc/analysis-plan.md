# Possible analyses
 1. Linear mixed-effects model on the effect of location, weather, traffic, and noise on the abundance of swallows. (BBS data)
 2. MANOVA on the effect of habitat type on the abundance of swallows.
 3. Fit different time series population models to the declining swallow population.
 
 # Possible results tables
 1. ANOVA table from the mixed effect models. 
 2. MANOVA table
 
 # Possible results figures
 1. Plot showing swallow abundance through time. 
 2. Heat map of swallow presence through time. 
 3. Potential interaction plots showing effect of environmental varaibles on swallow abundance
 4. Plots showing the fit of population models to the data
