# Code of Conduct

1. No harassment, on the context of sex, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, race, physical appearance, physical or mental disabilities, and all other protected ground. Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

2. Respect each group member. Be kind to others. Provide feedback and criticism on the basis of behavior and events rather than the person. No name calling. 

3. Use positive and community-building language. All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you, even those outside the group .

4. Each member is expected to contribute equally to the final project and to the best of their ability. All members are expected to attend all alloted meeting times (i.e. lecture time) unless necessary. Absences should be communicated at least **12 hours** before the meeting time and all other members need to approve the request of absence.

5. Be professional during time alloted to work. There will be time for socialization during break times and potential further group bonding timess, so please limit chatter unrelated to work during group meeting times to a minimum.

**If a group member engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, a time will be arranged to discuss the behavior. They might be reported to the course instructors anonymously if inappropriate behaviro persists.**
